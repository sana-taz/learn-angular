      Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript.
      Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page
      applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also
      providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables
      users to create large applications in a maintainable manner.

      JavaScript is the most commonly used client-side scripting language. It is
      written into HTML documents to enable interactions with web pages in many
      unique ways. As a relatively easy-to-learn language with pervasive
      support, it is well-suited to develop modern applications.

    <div class="text-gray-800 font-normal text-base my-4 content-center">
      But is JavaScript ideal for developing single-page applications that
      require modularity, testability, and developer productivity? Perhaps not.

      These days, we have a variety of frameworks and libraries designed to
      provide alternative solutions. With respect to front-end web development,
      Angular addresses many, if not all, of the issues developers face when
      using JavaScript on its own.
